For the website I've built, the overall authentication system and dashboard are designed with a focus on security and user experience. Users can only access the dashboard and audit trail sections after logging in, ensuring that sensitive information is protected. Authentication is managed using tokens, which are securely stored in session storage. This setup not only verifies the user's identity but also maintains their authenticated state across different parts of the application, streamlining interactions with various APIs and ensuring that only authorized users can access specific features.

The website is built using Next.js, a powerful framework for React applications, and utilizes Material-UI (MUI) for layout and design. While MUI provides a robust set of pre-made components, the customization process can be challenging due to the complexities involved in overriding default styles and adapting the components to fit specific design requirements. Nonetheless, this approach allows for a more consistent and professional look across the site, making the user interface both visually appealing and functional.
